            "description": "Austin was a city in Texas where Joel, Tommy, and Sarah lived before the cordyceps outbreak. Joel and Sarah's house was a short journey from the main city. There was plenty of grassland and even a farm in the area.nThe main city had hotels, gas stations, and several bars. There was also a hospital located next to the main 71 highway. There was also a police station in the area, big enough to house at least six police cars. When the outbreak occurred, the city quickly fell into chaos, with many people either dying outright or becoming infected. While fleeing into the city, Joel, Tommy and Sarah noticed a barn on fire. Tommy and Joel briefly remarked that it was owned by a man called Louis, the pair hoping he made it out alive. Years later, Tommy returned to the city and found Joel's old house, the city likely deserted, He claimed there wasn't much left, but he did manage to salvage a photo.",

As of 2033, FEDRA and the military currently control it, the city acting as one of the last functioning Quarantine Zones in America. Although Firefly attacks occur frequently, Boston has not devolved into a total war-zone as other cities had. Indeed, Boston currently doesn't experience riots, and the military's hard crack down on the local Fireflies keeps the zone functioning. The Boston QZ corresponds to the real-life North End neighborhood of Boston, known for being the oldest residential community in the city and a hub for Italian-Americans.",

It is where Tommy and Maria currently reside. Interestingly, no Infected are encountered in the area. The reason for this is unknown, although a possible explanation is the apparent remoteness from any large towns or cities. The county seems like an ideal location to avoid the outbreak, although Tommy mentions that attacks by Infected still occur. Wyoming, as evidenced through the players' journeys with Tommy, has several farms and is rich in both vegetation and wildlife. In the last level of the game, if one looks closely at the town while overlooking it on the hill with Joel, survivors can be seen walking around the town.",
